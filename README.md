# Facebook Pano Prepper

A Windows desktop application that helps prepare panoramic images for optimal display on Facebook by adding the required metadata and adjusting image properties to ensure proper 360-degree viewing. Today many cameras, DJI Drones for example, create images that Facebook will identify as panoramic images. If you resize the images or do any kind of work on them, you will have to use an application like Facebook Pano Prepper to fix the meta tags so that Facebook correctly display them as 360 panoramic images.

## Web Hosting Capability

In addition to preparing your panoramas for Facebook, the HTML code generated by this application can be uploaded to a web server and you can build a complete panorama homepage very easily. The application creates a web-hosting ready structure that can be deployed to any web server:

```
/Batch_[timestamp]/
├── images/ # Contains processed panorama images
├── viewer.html # Main viewer interface
└── processing_report.txt
```
### Hosting Options

1. **Local Viewing**
   - Use the built-in web server (recommended)
   - Open viewer.html directly in a browser

2. **Web Hosting**
   - Upload the entire batch folder to any web hosting service
   - Works with any standard HTTP server
   - Compatible with:
     - GitHub Pages
     - Apache
     - Nginx
     - IIS
     - Any standard web hosting service

3. **Requirements for Web Hosting**
   - HTTP/HTTPS server
   - Support for static files
   - No special server-side requirements
   - No database needed

4. **Quick Hosting Guide**
   - Copy the entire batch folder to your web server
   - Ensure proper file permissions (typically 644 for files, 755 for directories)
   - Access through your domain: `http(s)://yourdomain.com/path/to/batch/viewer.html`

5. **Security Considerations**
   - The viewer is client-side only
   - No server-side processing required
